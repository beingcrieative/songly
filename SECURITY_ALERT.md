# üö® SECURITY ALERT - API Keys Exposed

## Problem

The `.env.example` file contained **real API keys** and was committed to git. This means your API keys are **publicly accessible** on GitHub in the git history.

## Exposed Keys (Need to be Rotated)

The following keys were exposed and should be regenerated immediately:

### 1. InstantDB Keys
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTANT_APP_ID`: `38076a85-d3e4-47ce-972a-079962f6cb9b`
- `INSTANT_APP_ADMIN_TOKEN`: `1c3c1acb-645c-4d37-bfc7-9c9b88b55e71`
- `INSTANT_CLI_AUTH_TOKEN`: `bfa531b5-e5b1-4f7e-b4a9-311251998951`

**Action Required:**
1. Go to: https://instantdb.com/dash
2. Navigate to your app settings
3. Regenerate/rotate these keys
4. Update them in Vercel Environment Variables

### 2. OpenRouter API Key
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: `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`

**Action Required:**
1. Go to: https://openrouter.ai/keys
2. Delete the exposed key
3. Generate a new key
4. Update it in Vercel Environment Variables

### 3. Suno API Key
- `SUNO_API_KEY`: `ed1d9fbbab21bc78e944027e5d31b290`

**Action Required:**
1. Go to your Suno dashboard
2. Regenerate API key
3. Update it in Vercel Environment Variables

## What We Fixed

1. ‚úÖ Replaced `.env.example` with **placeholder values only**
2. ‚úÖ Ensured `.env` (with real values) stays in `.gitignore`
3. ‚úÖ Created this security alert document

## What You Need to Do

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Regenerate All API Keys** (see sections above)
2. **Update Vercel Environment Variables** with new keys
3. **Never commit real keys again**

### Optional but Recommended

**Clean Git History** (removes keys from history permanently):

```bash
# WARNING: This rewrites git history and requires force push
# Only do this if you're the only one working on the repo

# Install git-filter-repo
pip install git-filter-repo

# Remove the old .env.example from entire history
git filter-repo --path .env.example --invert-paths

# Force push to GitHub (WARNING: destructive!)
git push origin --force --all
```

**Note:** If other people have cloned the repo, they'll need to re-clone after history rewrite.

### Alternative (Simpler but Less Secure)

If you can't rewrite history, at least:
1. Rotate all keys immediately
2. Add this commit to git history showing you fixed it
3. Monitor your accounts for unauthorized usage

## Future Prevention

### For Local Development

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Fill in your **real** keys in `.env` (never commit this!)

3. Verify `.env` is in `.gitignore`:
   ```bash
   git check-ignore .env
   # Should output: .env
   ```

### Best Practices

- ‚úÖ **DO**: Keep real keys in `.env` (ignored by git)
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Use placeholders in `.env.example`
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Store production keys in Vercel Dashboard
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Rotate keys regularly
- ‚ùå **DON'T**: Ever commit files with real API keys
- ‚ùå **DON'T**: Share API keys via Slack/Discord/Email
- ‚ùå **DON'T**: Hardcode keys in source code

## Verifying Your Keys Are Safe

After rotating keys, verify:

```bash
# Check what's in git
git show HEAD:.env.example | grep -i "key\|token\|secret"

# Should only show placeholders like:
# your-key-here
# your-token-here
```
