# PRD-0016 Test Fixes Summary

## Test Failures Fixed

### 1. Integration Tests - Invalid Status Values

**Issue**: Tests used `'generating'` status which doesn't exist in `GENERATING_STATUSES`

**Valid Statuses**: Only `'generating_lyrics'` and `'generating_music'` are recognized

**Files Fixed**:
- `src/lib/utils/concurrentGenerations.integration.test.ts`

**Changes Made**:
- Line 99: Changed `'generating'` → `'generating_music'`
- Lines 114-116: Changed three `'generating'` → `'generating_music'`
- Line 130: Changed `'generating'` → `'generating_music'`
- Lines 270-272: Changed three `'generating'` → `'generating_music'`

**Tests Fixed**: 4 integration tests
- ✅ should allow multiple concurrent generations for premium users
- ✅ should block when premium limit reached
- ✅ should only count generating songs, not completed ones
- ✅ should handle premium user with queue management

---

### 2. useActionItemsCount Tests - Mock Data Issues

**Issue**: Mock was returning ALL songs, but InstantDB filters on the backend

**Root Cause**: The hook uses `db.useQuery()` which filters server-side. Our mocks should return only the filtered results, not all songs.

**Files Fixed**:
- `src/hooks/useActionItemsCount.test.ts`

**Changes Made**:
- Line 38-45: Removed `generating_lyrics` song from mock (only actionable songs returned)
- Line 53-61: Removed `generating_music` song from mock
- Line 82-92: Removed generating songs from mock (only 3 actionable songs)
- Line 99-105: Changed mock to return empty array (generating songs filtered out)

**Tests Fixed**: 4 hook tests
- ✅ should count songs with lyrics_ready status
- ✅ should count songs with ready status
- ✅ should count all actionable statuses
- ✅ should NOT count generating statuses

---

### 3. getBaseUrl Tests - Environment Issues

**Issue**: Tests run in DOM environment where `window` exists, so `getBaseUrl()` always returns `window.location.origin`

**Root Cause**: Vitest defaults to `jsdom` environment. The function checks `typeof window !== 'undefined'` which is true in jsdom, so it never reaches the server-side logic being tested.

**Files Fixed**:
- `src/lib/utils/getBaseUrl.test.ts`

**Changes Made**:
- Line 5: Added `@vitest-environment node` comment to force Node environment

**Tests Fixed**: 3 getBaseUrl tests
- ✅ returns custom base URL when NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL is set
- ✅ returns Vercel URL when VERCEL_URL is set
- ✅ prefers custom base URL over Vercel URL

## Remaining Test Failures (Not PRD-0016 Related)

### React Component Tests (Pre-existing issues)

**Files with failures**:
- `src/components/ParameterSheet.test.tsx` - 8 failures
- `src/components/Avatar.test.tsx` - 2 failures
- `src/components/ChatBubble.test.tsx` - 2 failures
- `src/components/mobile/NavTabs.test.tsx` - InstantDB initialization error

**Issue**: Missing `React` import in test files

**Not Related to PRD-0016**: These are pre-existing test issues

**Fix Required** (for user to implement):
```typescript
import React from 'react';  // Add to each failing test file
```

---

### E2E Tests (Pre-existing issues)

**Files with failures**:
- `tests/e2e/app.spec.ts`
- `tests/e2e/console.spec.ts`
- `tests/e2e/network.spec.ts`

**Issue**: "Playwright Test did not expect test.describe() to be called here"

**Not Related to PRD-0016**: Playwright configuration issue

**Root Cause**: Likely version mismatch or configuration issue in `playwright.config.ts`
